		<assemblyVersion>1.8.1</assemblyVersion>
		<content>
- New class: Priest - support class that excels at improving the health of colonists.
Abilities:
Advanced Heal - similar to the Paladin's heal, except it can be leveled higher and is more potent.  Points invested in Advanced Heal also apply to Heal, if the Priest acquires the Heal spell through a scroll.
Purify - Cleanses many deep seated injuries and natural human conditions.  It also has the power to help reduce or remove addiction withdrawals.
Healing Circle - creates a temporary circle that generates waves of healing power.
Bestow Might - Powerful, single target buff that enhances many combat related attributes.
Resurrection (master) - revives a recently deceased pawn.  Effects are similar to resurrection serum but, through skill improvements, the likelihood of resurrection sickness effects can be reduced.

- New class: Ranger - a versitile class; able to form a bond with an animal and readily faces the many hardships of RimWorld.
Abilities:
Ranger Training - surviving in the wilds can teach the ranger many useful skills
Bow Mastery - training with the bow increases the overall lethality when using bows
Poison Trap - using skills learned in fieldcraft, the ranger can emplace traps filled with druidic poison to impare and disuade enemies.  The ranger's skill at emplacing these traps puts mechanical sensors to shame.
Animal Bond - forms a bond with an animal of the wild that benefits both ranger and beast
Arrow Storm - launches a volley of arrows at a target, but cannot be used without a bow

- Necromancer's will no longer complain about seeing, or making, corpses...

- Fixed several undead animal need related bugs.  Continued refinement of Undead thought generation and interaction.

- Druid "Regrow Limb" now uses it's own recipe class and should have less chance to conflict with other mods; failure no longer restores the limb and success no longer sends the failure letter.

- Caravan fixes: mana is now gained while caravaning; undead no longer throw errors in a caravan; in addition, undead in a caravan require a necromancer in the caravan to survive - if no necromancer exist in the caravan with the undead, they lose the source of arcane power that sustains them and will return to the dead (all held items will transfer to another pawn).

- AI will now buff themselves before entering combat.

		<assemblyVersion>1.8.3</assemblyVersion>
		<content>
- Minions and Elementals should no longer generate errors from frostbite or hypothermia.

- Elemental Rift event will now end correctly following a reload.

- The Necromancer skill "Cheating Death" will also add a reduction in undead upkeep cost.  Undead should no longer attempt tasks they cannot perform.
Feeling singled out, Necromancers have begun returning the social distaste expressed by paladins, priests, and druids.

- A Mod Setting has been added to allow players to adjust the rarity of magic traits.

- The Arcane Fold, in response to increased threats against their caravans and colonies, has increased the training and equipment of their guards.

- The Magic pane displays points required to learn class spells;  spells that haven't been learned yet will no longer give the option to upgrade a related skill. 

- The mana cost for Summoner skills has increased slightly. Each minion now requires an upkeep cost that reduces the amount of mana a summoner gains each turn by 20%.  Unlike undead, minion upkeep costs are not shared, and each summoner may only have 4 minions at any given time.  Summoning additional minions over this amount will dismiss the oldest minion.  The duration of a summoned minion has doubled and its cooldown has been drastically reduced.

		<content>
- The spellcasting order of events has been changed.  When an ability is used, experience gain, effects on the pawn, and mana/stamina consumption all occur following the cast timer rather than before.  This also prevents spell stacking.

- Abilities used when the target is out of range or if the target is not visible to the caster will generate an error message and abort using the ability; mana/Stamina will no longer be consumed in these cases.

		<assemblyVersion>1.9.0</assemblyVersion>
		<content>
- The Magical Enchanting feature has been introduced.  Enchanting offers mages the ability to further refine and empower any piece of equipment. To get started, you can find the research options under the "Magic" research tab.  
There is also an in-depth tutorial in the in-game tutor menu that will guide you through the process.

- Several new mod options have been added for further tailoring of AI abilities and game features.

- Summoned creatures and structures have been reworked to increase the reliability of their intended behavior and improve functionality.  Existing summons will be unaffected.

		<defName>ARimWorldOfMagic_1_9_2</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.9.2</assemblyVersion>
		<content>
- Seven new fighter class specific abilities have been added. These abilities are 'sustained' meaning they require a set amount of stamina to maintain the ability.
The sustainment cost is subtracted from the users maximum stamina. These skills can be toggled on and off as desired, some of these skills have additional costs or side effects to maintain.
Skills:
Sprint - increase movement rate but quickly exhausts the user (Gladiator class can improve this skill through training)
Gear Repair - fighter classes rely on their equipment and take the initiative to maintain and repair equipped apparel and weapons
Inner Healing - focuses physical energy to slowly heal injuries, some physical capacities are reduced while this skill is active
Heavy Blow - increase melee damage multiplier by 20%
Strong Back - dedicates stamina to increase carrying and inventory capacity, slightly increases exhaustion
Thick Skin - gains bonuses to armor class and temperature thresholds
Fighters Focus - dedicates physical energy to focus on, and overcome, mental and physical thresholds

- Fighter skills that applied passive boosts or trait increases now take effect automatically, and apply upgrades automatically.  The ability buttons for these skills will not be visible.

- Fighters and Mages have each gained a new global skill that increases their respective stamina and mana capacities.

- Inherited abilities for Summon Minion and Raise Undead have been added to improve Undead and Minion management. These skills become available automatically when a mage is supporting one or more of these creatures.
No additional scrolls or training is required to learn these skills.

- A new standalone mage spell has been added: Arcane Power Node - generates a small amount of power for several days. 
Existing abilities "Moisturize Ground" and "Dry Ground" now effect a 3x3 square; mana costs were appropriately increased.
The "Rainmaker" ability can now be used to stop rain or snow.

- Bug fix - several fighter skills were not triggering a hostile reponse, they are now.

		<defName>ARimWorldOfMagic_1_9_6</defName>
		<assemblyVersion>1.9.6</assemblyVersion>
		<content>
- The Paladin, Necromancer, and Summoner master spells have been added:

Paladin - Holy Wrath: calls or a hammers of light to smash upon the land

Necromancer - Lich Form: the necromancer steps further along the path of the dark mage by becoming an undead; by doing so, they lose interest in almost all mundane tasks but gain the Death Bolt and Flight powers
The necromancer "Death Mark" power has been reworked. It now functions as a curse that will slow the attack speed of any enemy affected. The fear that Death Mark induces also becomes a source of power that the lich will use to empower Death Bolt
Undead workspeeds have been reduced but will gain the benefits of the "Hastened Undead" skill towards global work speed

Summoner - Summon Poppi: a curious creature that fights more ferociously than any other creature on the rim, a true demon in disguise

- New stand-alone spell "Sun Light" - creates a node of light powerful enough to grow plants but places a continous demand on the mage sustaining the light.

- Ranger pets now require a cost to maintain; rangers will be more sensitive to the loss of their bonded companions.

- Several new weapons to include the Thrumbo Axe, which is powerful enough to perform cleaving blows, and the Staff of the Defender that enables any mage to form temporary arcane barriers
	
- Special thanks to contributor Angry Wizard for improving many of the UI icons and Dianne for the Poppi graphics!
