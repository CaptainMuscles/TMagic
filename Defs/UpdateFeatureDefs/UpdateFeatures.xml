Update 2.3.2 contains new artifacts and generic mage spells.

**Craftable artifacts:**
Bracers of the Pacifist - can only be worn by non-violent pawns but adds considerable stats and magic bonuses
Bracers of Deflection - 30% chance to block physical attacks and deflect projectiles to nearby enemies
Bracers of Defense - 40% chance to block physical attacks
Ring of Keen Intellect - increases the rate at which a pawn can learn and research, but increases mental stress

The Psionic, Bloodmage, and Deathknight each have a unique ring that increases their unique energy pool; each of these rings can 'grow' depending on the actions and records of the wearer.

**Non-craftable artifacts:**
Orb of Conviction - can be used to instantly convince a human-like pawn from another faction to join your cause
Orb of Souls - can harvest the soul of another pawn, stripping them of their traits; the orb will then be filled and can be used to transfer those traits into another pawn - some side effects may occur, including but not limited to death
Orb of the Eternal - an orb infused with a single blast of healing magic - heals wounds, cures diseases, and restores limbs

New generic mage spell: Blur - 20% chance to dodge any non-explosive attack, sustained spell that requires 20% mana to maintain
New enchanter spell: Blank Mind - wipes any non-persistent memory from the pawn and causes them to enter a confused state for a brief period; can also be used on enemies to disorient (stun) them

Tweaks:
Available after researching arcane crafting: wanderer's cloak, royal armor and helm, dark robe, arcane hood, all wands, elephant spear and bow
Available after researching arcane apparel: robes of the archmage, robes of supremacy (renamed cloak of supremacy), paragon's helm, hood of madness, thrum bow, both staves
Ability cost reduction is now hard-capped at 50% of the base ability cost

Bug Fixes:
Faceless reversal will reflect projectiles from turrets
