**Magic Development: Update #1**

Magic development updates will focus on adding new methods to develop and improve the colony through magical means.

New work type: Magic - mages selected for this work type will automatically perform various magic related tasks such as charging a portal or crafting at an arcane workbench; work type can be toggled under work settings

New research: Arcane Storage - allows construction of the Arcane Capacitor and Dimensional Mana Pocket

New research: Arcane cultivation - allows growing and creation of Pomanasyrrium, a fruit that enhances arcane senses

New structure: Arcane Capacitor - allows mages to transfer mana into the arcane capacitor and absorb it at a later time

New structure: Dimensional Mana Pocket - similar to the arcane capacitor but has significantly more storage capacity and discharge range but redistributes mana at a slower rate

New plant: Pomanasyrrium bush - produces fruit typically consumed as a delicacy, pomanasyrrium has unique properties that enhance a mages access to mana.  This chemical is called Syrrium and can be extracted from raw pomanasyrrium to concentrate the effects.

Tweaks:
Undead will not auto-undraft
Arcane apparel (all pieces) will inherit defense and insulation properties of the material used in creation; any magic apparel with specific material requirements were replaced with stuff categories
Added options to the mod settings to disable appearance changes for undead animals and pawns
Added an option to toggle mage and fighter level up messages
Added a gizmo for the technomancer to toggle the repair function

Bug fixes: 
Maps will no longer close when using the succubus ability 'Scorn' and the succubus is the only player owned pawn on the map
Fixed a bug with autocast phase strike and blink that was selecting the incorrect target during haul/load jobs
Wildman pawns will not generate errors if they are a mage or fighter
Rangers cannot bond animals that belong to another faction and will dismiss a bonded animal that is a member of a caravan if they choose to form another bond
Necromancer ability 'Consume Corpse' will not generate errors if a vampire (or pawn type lacking certain needs) uses the ability

*Research: Forge Replication - enhance the arcane forge with a technique that allows it to replicate the design of almost any craftable item

*Structure: Arcane Forge - a powerful crafting table that dramatically accelerates crafting speeds and can apply these bonuses to any design it replicates; the forge can only be used by mages and consumes mana during the crafting process

*Plant: Paracyte thornbush - a delicate plant known for its keen beauty - its slow to grow but able to produce small quantities of magicyte; can also grow without light but at a slower rate

*Material: Manaweave - cloth infused with magicyte and arcane runes that enhances the magical enchantments of any apparel made from manaweave

Tweaks:
Psychic shock is less likely to deal lethal brain damage; implemented several tweaks to improve its performance
Sentinels will only evaluate prisoners as threats if the prisoner is performing hostile actions

Bug fixes: 
Druids can now write their Arcane Tome correctly
Fixed a bug with Overdrive that was generated when turrets had a null map (eg when mounted on a mechanoid)
Fixed several bugs with resurrection that could occur if the corpse moved, was being carried, or was destroyed or if the game was saved and loaded during the resurrection process
Fixed a bug with the mana drain incident if the player was present on 2 or more maps
