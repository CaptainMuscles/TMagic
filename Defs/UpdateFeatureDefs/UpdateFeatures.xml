- A Chinese translation has been added to the mod - big thanks to KuanKuan!

- The Elemental Rift event has undergone some changes.  When a rift occurs, the element type is determined and will remain that type for the remainder of the event.  Each element type is accompanied by a unique set of atmospheric conditions that will present additional challenges to the colony.

- Magicyte can now be extracted from dead elementals at the butchery table.

- The exact mana gain can now be seen under the Magic tab; hovering over the value will provide a tooltip showing contributors to the amount.

- Enchantments are now shown under an item in the gear/inventory tab; this should make it much easier to find equipped items that have enchantments. The characters shown in parenthesis are a quick code for the types of enchantments affecting the item; mousing over the text will also bring up a tooltip that shows the exact enchantments.

- Research tiers have been adjusted slightly to split projects into either neolithic or medieval; net research costs are approximately the same.

- Casting graphics have been added to help identify friendly and enemy pawns that are casting a spell.

- Other miscellaneous updates include improvements for Spell Mending, thrumbo horns have been added as a resource requirement for the thrumbo axe, jade has been added to arcane traders, undead can no longer be captured and more!

- New Class: Faceless (might) - faceless excel at manipulation, perception, and deception; through their cunning tactics, they can take the strength of another and make it their own. 
*Deception - exploiting knowledge of how other pawns perceive things, the faceless are able to blend into the canopy, becoming just another harmless object to an observer, making themselves all but invisible. Performing hostile actions will break the deception.
*Mimic - creates an imitation of a fighter or mage skill; can be used on enemy or friendly pawns alike to acquire a one-time-use ability.
*Reversal - reverses the kinetic energy of projectile and melee attacks back towards the attacker for a short time
*Transpose - the faceless takes the place of another pawn and forces the other pawn to take its place
*Possess - confuses the mind of a target pawn to gain (limited) control over their body; if used on a willing host, the faceless enhances physical capability of the host
 
- New mod options have been added to allow you to mark enemy fighter classes; another new option allows friendly pawns (mages and fighters) to also be marked.

- Global skills Spirit (mage) and Endurance (fighter) now give 4% boost to their respective resource pool maximum levels (was 2%).

- New Class: Warlock/Succubus - gaining their power through a demonic contract, this class is gender specific where each gender shares common powers but are also uniquely diverse in both roles and application of their powers.
*Soul Bond - form a contract with another colonist that allows the class to gain additional power; this weakens the capacity of the bonded pawn but eases the burden of their reality...
>>Forming a soul bond grants a unique link between the bonded pawn and the warlock or succubus that allows them to travel to, or summon, the bonded pawn across vast distances
*Shadow Bolt - launch a bolt of blackest shadow to consume the energy of everything along its path
*Dominate - an infectious calamity of nightmares and fears that erodes the sanity of its victims
*(Warlock) Repulsion - detonate a burst of raw energy that repels any nearby pawns
*(Succubus) Attraction - create an inescapable pit of darkness that draws victims into the center and surrounds them in clinging shadows
*(Warlock - Master) Psychic Shock - release all mental barriers and emit a powerful psychic shockwave to dominate the minds of nearby pawns
*(Succubus - Master) Scorn - reveal your true nature and crush your opponents in cascading wrath

- Several compatibility patches have been added for the Lord of the Rims mods that was preventing summoned creatures from spawning.

- (Bug fixes) Blink no longer charges double the stated casting cost; you can no longer raise summoned/elemental creatures as undead; undead should no longer be sellable; Undead animals will no longer procreate; Necromancer/Lich will now correctly write their Unfinished Arcane Tomes.

- Psychic Sensitivity now affects how powerful, and susceptible, a pawn is to magic.
- The Warlock and Succubus classes will exhibit unique social behaviors.  The Succubus is a bit more friendly and the Warlock may cause emotions to 'bleed' from, or to, other pawns via psychic empathy.
- A hidden combination ability has been added for Warlock and Succubus; not for the faint of heart.
- The arcane mine now has a small proximity detection and should be much more responsive to enemies passing nearby.
- The Bard class has been added to the random class pool.
- Psychic Shock will only damage the mind of an enemy once, but applies a stronger stun to enemies and a weaker stun to friendlies.
- Mod default settings for Magicyte rarity have been increased, in addition, most trader types will carry small amounts of magicyte for purchase (at higher costs than arcane vendors).
- Enchanting gem recipe's have been changed to only require a flat raw magicyte amount. This will reduce the overall time and cost to craft higher tier gems.
- Eye of the Storm master spell will discharge when it reaches its destination instead of just disappearing.

- New Class: Psionic - pawns influenced by increased sensitivity or events of psychic power and being physically adept allows access to a combat class that blends mental and physical strength to overcome challenges.

Psionics gain access to a unique mechanic called psionic energy; the balanced use of physical and psionic energy produces the most effective results for a psionic.

*Psionic Augmentation - a psionic is most efficient when combining physical and mental strength; psionic augmentation is the application of psionic energy into living tissue and practices in three major ways:
>Movement - infusing psionic energy into the core and legs the psionic is able to move at incredible speeds
>Manipulation - applying psionic energy into hands and arms increases manipulation speed and power
>Mind - exerts raw psionic power to strike at foes from a distance
*Psionic blast - launch a bolt of explosive energy; higher levels of psionic energy can produce multiple bolts
*Psionic dash - a physical burst of energy propelled by psionic energy causes the psionic to move at devastating speeds over a short distance
*Psionic storm - harnesses all reserves of psionic energy in a spectacular display of power

- New Class: Geomancer - the geomancer is a versatile support and defense magic class that is able to shape the elements of earth and manipulate the laws of physics.

*Stoneskin - well defined skill from DnD that absorbs a specific amount of attacks, regardless of the strength or weakness of the attack
*Encase	- an upheaval of stone and rock surrounds an area; can also be used effectively to isolate or restrict key terrain
*Earth Sprites - summon an earth sprite to do your dirty work for you - in exchange for excessive amounts of mana, earth sprites will mine rock or transform terrain
*Earthern Hammer - manipulates gravity to catapul nearby boulders at oncoming foes
*Sentinel - spruce up your fortress with mean looking gargoyles that do more than stare at trespassers

*Meteorite (master) - I'm supposed to write something about how this spell calls down a molten ball of death and destruction from the sky to decimate a large area and leave enemies asking "dude, where's my base?"
I'll think of something before I make this update...

Fighters rejoice! Enchantments now benefit fighter classes in a similar manner as magic classes; no additional recipes, workbenches, or materials needed.

The Faceless skill "mimic," when used by a non-violent pawn, will no longer assign a violent skill to that pawn.
