** New class: Deathknight - these warriors stand at the precipice of death and are among the toughest and most resolute fighters the rim has to offer; the closer they get to death, the more dangerous they become
-Shroud of Darkness: wreathed in an endless void, the shroud of darkness is the signature skill of any deathknight and is able to nullify attacks and increase their armor; its strength grows as the deathknight builds rage
-Wave of Fear: the deathknight amplifies the fears of their opponents to send them reeling and reduces their ability to resist dark attacks
-Spite: once sufficient rage is built, the deathknight can channel their malice into a physical attack, dealing a painful spirit attack at enemies up to medium range
-Spirit Tap: absorbs the life energy of enemies struck in melee range and uses it to build rage, restore energy, and heal their wounds and wounds of nearby allies
-Grave blade: calls forth the spirits of the dead to strike from the grave at any enemies in an a target area

*Equipment: Helm of the Valiant - special thanks to wrathofdog for the artwork; the helm of the valiant is a complimentary piece to the armor of the valiant and offers strong protection to frontline fighters

Fireball and Snowball now have additional flight effects
Paracyte yield reduced by 1

-Blood Gift: the source of a blood mage's power; Blood Gift is the mechanism used to infused blood with mana and fuel blood magic

-Ignite Blood: detonates all exposed blood in an area and blossoms like a wildfire to any nearby sources of blood

-Blood Moon (master): summon demons of blood and terror to assault all enemies in a large area

** New class: Enchanter - masters of transmutation, enchanters are able to modify the composition and arrangement of almost any material, be it organic or synthetic

-Transmute: converts stacks of raw resources into other raw resources

		<content>
Update 2.3.2 contains new artifacts and generic mage spells.

**Craftable artifacts:**
Bracers of the Pacifist - can only be worn by non-violent pawns but adds considerable stats and magic bonuses
Bracers of Deflection - 30% chance to block physical attacks and deflect projectiles to nearby enemies
Bracers of Defense - 40% chance to block physical attacks
Ring of Keen Intellect - increases the rate at which a pawn can learn and research, but increases mental stress

The Psionic, Bloodmage, and Deathknight each have a unique ring that increases their unique energy pool; each of these rings can 'grow' depending on the actions and records of the wearer.

**Non-craftable artifacts:**
Orb of Conviction - can be used to instantly convince a human-like pawn from another faction to join your cause
Orb of Souls - can harvest the soul of another pawn, stripping them of their traits; the orb will then be filled and can be used to transfer those traits into another pawn - some side effects may occur, including but not limited to death
Orb of the Eternal - an orb infused with a single blast of healing magic - heals wounds, cures diseases, and restores limbs

New generic mage spell: Blur - 20% chance to dodge any non-explosive attack, sustained spell that requires 20% mana to maintain
New enchanter spell: Blank Mind - wipes any non-persistent memory from the pawn and causes them to enter a confused state for a brief period; can also be used on enemies to disorient (stun) them

Tweaks:
Available after researching arcane crafting: wanderer's cloak, royal armor and helm, dark robe, arcane hood, all wands, elephant spear and bow
Available after researching arcane apparel: robes of the archmage, robes of supremacy (renamed cloak of supremacy), paragon's helm, hood of madness, thrum bow, both staves
Ability cost reduction is now hard-capped at 50% of the base ability cost

Bug Fixes:
Faceless reversal will reflect projectiles from turrets
