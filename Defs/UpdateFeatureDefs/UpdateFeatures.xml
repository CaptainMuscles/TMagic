Update 2.3.7

Magic Circle: mages perform group work to generate unique events.

Wandering Lich Event: A new, magic event that will challenge mid to late game colonies. Once the lich appears, it will resurrect undead minions and send waves of undead to assault the colony. This event comes with a fully tailorable difficulty scale that takes into account player wealth, storyteller difficulty, and a custom difficulty set in mod options.
	
Arcalleum - a unique alloy that has elastic properties that provide excellent defense against blunt attacks, but less than nominal use in weapons. Fighters and mages equipped with Arcalleum also benefit from its power to instantly reset abilities.
