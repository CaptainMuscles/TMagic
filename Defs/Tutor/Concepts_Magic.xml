		<helpText>Magical portals representation the height of magical power.  There are a few things you should know about using portals:

1. Only an Arcane mage trained in Gateway magic can activate a portal.
 a. The option to activate a portal only appears when the Arcane mage has enough mana (70%) for activation.
 b. When the Arcane mage activates the portal, it will move the selection menu to the world map - only a map actively occupied by colonists can be selected.
 c. Activation will drain the mage for a brief time, so choose your destination with care.
 
2. Once activated, any mage can charge the portal.
 a. The options to use (walk through) a portal or send items through the portal only appear when the portal has enough arcane energy stored to perform the action.
 b. Only one pawn at a time may use the portal; each pawn drains the portal by 5% of its maximum energy.
 c. All items are transmitted simultaneously; the cost to transfer items through a portal is 10% of its maximum energy.
 
3. Any pawn can use the portal.

4. Only mages can direct items through the portal.

5. Only mages can deactivate the portal.

6. When a portal deactivates, it will retain the arcane power stored until the portal is reactivated.
Portals must be deactivated before they can be reactivated and assigned a new destination.

7. Protect your portal - it is fragile, expensive, and stores a massive amount of energy...
